This is a project that will allow a user to organize and create new combinations of BeyBlade toys.

The user will:

    1) Be able to access a list of stock BeyBlades and the three components of which they are made.  These will be read from an external file.

    2) Be able to combine the various parts to create their own, custom BeyBlades.  These will be saved to an external file.

    3) Be able to rank the stock and custom BeyBlades in order of the users perception of the BeyBlade's performance.
