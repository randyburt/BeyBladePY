This is a project that will allow a user to organize and create new combinations of BeyBlade toys.

The user will:

    1) Be able to access a list of stock BeyBlades and the three components of which they are made.  These will be read from an external file.

    2) Be able to combine the various parts to create their own, custom BeyBlades.  These will be saved to an external file.

    3) Be able to rank the stock and custom BeyBlades in order of the users perception of the BeyBlade's performance.

Features addressed per Project Requirements:

#Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program

#Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data. The value of at least one object must be used somewhere in your code

#Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program

#Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application

###Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code. To clarify, at least one function should be called in your code, that function should calculate, retrieve, or otherwise set the value of a variable or data structure, return a value to where it was called, and use that value somewhere else in your code. For example, you could create a function that reads how many items there are in a text file, returns that value, and later uses that value to execute a loop a certain number of times.
